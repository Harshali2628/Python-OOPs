        "#Theory Question\n",
        "\n",
        "1.    What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "      - OOP is a programming paradigm centered around \"objects\"â€”software entities that encapsulate data and functions (methods) that operate on that data. It models real-world or abstract entities to organize code into reusable and modular units. Key OOP languages include Python, Java, C++, and others.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.   What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "     - A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes (data members) and methods (functions) common to all objects of that type. Classes allow grouping of data and behaviors into a reusable structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.   What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "     - An object is an instance of a class. It represents a specific entity with unique attribute values and can perform behaviors defined by its class methods. Objects encapsulate state and behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.   What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "     - Abstraction hides complex implementation details and shows only essential features to the user.\n",
        "     - Encapsulation restricts direct access to some of an object's components by bundling data and methods that operate on the data, often controlling access via private attributes and public methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.   What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "     - Dunder methods (double underscore methods) are special predefined methods like __init__, __str__, __repr__, __call__, etc. that provide operator overloading and custom behaviors for built-in Python operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.   Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "     - Inheritance allows a class (child/subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent/superclass), promoting code reuse and enabling hierarchical relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "7.   What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "     - Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, mainly through method overriding, enabling one interface to control access to a variety of underlying forms (data types).\n",
        "\n",
        "8.   How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "     - Encapsulation is done by using private or protected attributes (by prefixing attribute names with underscores) and exposing public methods (getters/setters) to manipulate these attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "9.   What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "     - A constructor is the special method __init__ used to initialize new  objects of a class with default or provided attribute values when the object is created.\n",
        "\n",
        "10.  What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "     - A class method (decorated with @classmethod) takes the class as the first parameter and can modify class state.\n",
        "     - A static method (decorated with @staticmethod) does not take the instance or class as mandatory parameters and behaves like a regular function within class scope.\n",
        "\n",
        "11.  What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "     - Python does not support traditional method overloading; it allows defining methods that accept variable numbers of arguments or use default values to achieve similar flexibility.\n",
        "\n",
        "12.  What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "     - Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method already defined in its superclass, enabling dynamic polymorphism.\n",
        "\n",
        "13.  What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "     - The @property decorator in Python is used to customize getters, setters, and deleters for class attributes, enabling controlled access and modification with attribute-like syntax.\n",
        "\n",
        "14.  Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "     - Polymorphism provides flexibility and reusability, allowing different classes to be used interchangeably through a common interface, reducing code complexity and enhancing extensibility.\n",
        "\n",
        "15.  What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "     - An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and typically contains one or more abstract methods that must be implemented by subclasses. They are defined using the abc module.\n",
        "\n",
        "16.  What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "     - OOP enhances code reusability, modularity, scalability, ease of maintenance, and models complex systems naturally, aligning software design closer to real-world concepts.\n",
        "\n",
        "17.  What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "     - Class variables are shared among all instances of a class.\n",
        "     - Instance variables are unique to each object/instance, holding data specific to that object.\n",
        "\n",
        "18.  What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "     - Multiple inheritance is when a class inherits features from more than one parent class, allowing combination of behaviors but may introduce complexity like the \"diamond problem\".\n",
        "\n",
        "19.  Explain the purpose of ''__str__' and '__repr__'' methods in Python.\n",
        "     - __str__ provides a readable string representation of an object for end-users.\n",
        "     - __repr__ provides an unambiguous string representation useful for developers and debugging.\n",
        "\n",
        "20.  What is the significance of the 'super()' function in Python?\n",
        "     - super() is used to call methods from a parent class in a child class, facilitating method inheritance and enabling extension or modification of base class behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "21.  What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "     - __del__ is a destructor method that is called when an object is about to be destroyed, and it is used for cleanup actions like releasing resources .\n",
        "\n",
        "22.  What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "     - @staticmethod defines a method that does not receive the instance or class as the first argument, while @classmethod receives the class itself as the first argument and can modify class state.\n",
        "\n",
        "23.  How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "     - Polymorphism works by allowing a subclass to override a method of its superclass so that the subclass version is used when called from an instance of the subclass, supporting dynamic method dispatch.\n",
        "\n",
        "24.  What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "     - Method chaining is a technique where multiple methods are called in a single line on an object by returning the object itself (usually via return self), enabling fluent coding style.\n",
        "\n",
        "25.  What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "     - The __call__ method allows an object to be called like a function, enabling instances to be used as callable objects with custom behavior.\n"
